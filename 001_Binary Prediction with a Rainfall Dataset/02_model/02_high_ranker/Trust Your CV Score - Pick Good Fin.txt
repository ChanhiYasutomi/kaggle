Trust Your CV Score - Pick Good Final Submissions!
There are 24 hours left! Good luck everyone and pick good final submissions!

I want to remind everyone that the public LB is unreliable in this competition. It is tempting to select final submissions with strong public LB score, but I believe in this competition that best CV score will win. Therefore I suggest that we ignore the many high scoring public LB notebooks (including my public ensemble starter notebooks)!

Personally, I believe that CV scores between 0.87 and 0.91 are good. And corresponding LB scores between 0.84 to 0.88 are good.

Also I believe that it is possible to overfit train data in this comp and observe inflated CV scores with complicated feature engineering and/or models. So I suggest that we keep everything simple!

Good luck!

UPDATE: My final two selections were:

CV = 0.900, Public LB = 0.857, Private = 0.90604
CV = 0.901, Public LB = 0.867, Private = 0.90599
